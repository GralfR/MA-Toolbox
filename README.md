# MA-Toolbox
Some (more or less) usefull stuff when working with grandMA by MA Lighting...

# Intro
Well, there are a lot of tools, macros, plugins, apps out in the web that promise to improve your workflow on grandMA consoles. Why yet another one?
Just because I wasn't able to find a solution for a problem I had. So I coded my own tool/macro/plugins. Most of them are obvious and trivial like "cue thru" on a grandMA series 1 just to select all fixtures used inside the selected sequence (equals "selfix" on MA2 and MA3).
Other tools are more complicated and specialized to a certain setup. Maybe I'll publish them someday, because maybe the core of the solution might inspire somebody to solve a similar problem.
So, this place here might grow during the next years...

Well this was the initial spark to create this repo.
